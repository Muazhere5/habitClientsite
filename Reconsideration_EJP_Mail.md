Assalamualaikum,
I hope the entire Programming Hero team is doing well.
I am writing this email with respect and sincerity regarding my current situation in the course.My name is Abdullah Al Muaz,

Phone: +8801825837673First of all, I am truly grateful for everything Programming Hero has taught me so far. The course structure, support, and guidance have played a major role in helping me grow as a developer.From the beginning of the course up to Assignment-10, I have consistently maintained my performance and completed all assignments on time, achieving an average score of 59+ marks.However, during November, I faced an unavoidable academic burden:I am currently in my 4th Year, 1st Semester at NSTU (Dept. of ICE)I had to prepare for both my current final exams and also retake exams from 1st & 2nd yearThese exams are extremely important for me to clear this semesterBalancing university finals + retakes + milestone-10 + assignment-10 at the same time became very difficult for me.
This delayed my ability to submit Assignment-10 within the regular time frame.Even then, I kept trying continuously because I am deeply committed to the course. 

After days of struggle, learning, and hard work, I finally completed Assignment-10 with confidence.
I strongly believe this is one of my best assignments and I am expecting full marks, In Shaa Allah.I also applied the ExamShield (November) extension, which allowed me to submit before 27th November, and I successfully submitted within that allowed time.However, due to this exam pressure, I unfortunately missed the chance to join Early Job Placement (EJP).

I am writing this email to humbly request the Programming Hero Admin Team to kindly consider my situation and allow me to join the Early Job Placement (EJP) program.I have been consistent, dedicated, and serious about this course since day one.
This month’s unexpected exam pressure was beyond my control, and I truly tried my best to keep up.I need EJP Bootcamp for following goals:I want to learn industry-level developmentI want to become job-ready as early as possibleI want to utilize all the skills I have built through this coursei belived that working is the best process for learning and remembering,so i want to attach with companies from now to adjust with industry level-environments.

  I assure the team that I am fully committed to maintaining my performance, working harder than before, and following every instruction responsibly. In Shaa Allah, I will prove myself deserving of the opportunity. 

Thank you sincerely to the Programming Hero team for the support, guidance, and inspiration you continuously provide. I am truly grateful to be a part of this journey, and I humbly request your kind consideration to allow me into the Early Job Placement program.
